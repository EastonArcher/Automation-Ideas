### PDF Merger

This is a simple Python script that uses the PyPDF2 library to merge multiple PDF files effortlessly. By simply placing the script in the same directory as the target PDF files, it automatically identifies and combines all PDFs into a single file named "Combined.pdf". This streamlined approach enhances efficiency and simplifies the process of merging PDF documents.

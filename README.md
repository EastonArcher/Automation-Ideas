### PDF Merger

This is a simple Python script that uses the PyPDF2 library to merge multiple PDF files effortlessly. By simply placing the script in the same directory as the target PDF files, it automatically identifies and combines all PDFs into a single file named "Combined.pdf". This streamlined approach enhances efficiency and simplifies the process of merging PDF documents.

### Photo Editor

This Photo Editor Automation program, utilizes the Pillow library to apply a series of image enhancements and effects to a collection of images. The script is designed to process images located in the 'imgs' folder, and the edited versions are saved in the 'editedImgs' folder. The edits include sharpening, rotation, contrast adjustment, color inversion, horizontal and vertical flipping, and additional effects. The script streamlines the editing process, allowing users to easily apply a consistent set of modifications to a batch of images, enhancing their visual appeal.
